# My Closet

My Closet is an application that will allow users to navigate their closets 
virtually. Users will first create an account, then they will be able to add 
items from their physical closet to their virtual one.  After items have 
been added, they will be able to generate potential outfits based on style, 
weather, and other criteria. 

Our application allows users to have a virtual closet on their android. Users are able to generate outfits based on their inventory and weather.
